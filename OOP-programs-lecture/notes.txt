===========================================================

PHP_EOL : used to find the newline character in a cross-platform-compatible way, so it handles DOS/Unix issues.

Note that PHP_EOL represents the endline character for the current system. For instance, it will not find a Windows endline when executed on a unix-like system

it should be use as the end-line character when writing a command-line script.
===============================================================
inheritance

- PHP supports single & multilevel inheritance. 
- It does not support multiple inheritance.
- In single inheritance, by using the extend keyword a class can inherit 
  methods and members of another base class (only one). 
- PHP uses the concept of inheritance only in the object model.
- If a class extends another then the parent class is to be declared 
  before  the child class.
- The classes must be defined before they are used.
